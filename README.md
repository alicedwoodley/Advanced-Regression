# Advanced Regression & Multivariate Analysis

This repository contains my work as part of the M-Level module [Advanced Regression and Multivariate Analysis](https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/MAT00094M/latest). 

'Module_Data.Rdata' contains all the data used across all 10 practicals.

(I aim to eventually replace the R script files with Quarto files)

## Practical summaries

**Practical 1** - R basics, bivariate data and correlation, checking normality and histograms.

**Practical 2** - Simulation, Mahalanobis distance and $\chi^2$ Q-Q plots.

**Practical 3** - $T^2$ tests and MANOVA.

**Practical 4** - Principal components analysis.

**Practical 5** - Factor analysis.

**Practical 6** - Linear regression.

**Practical 7** - Multilevel models.

**Practical 8** - Three level models and models of repeated measures.

**Practical 9** - To be completed on 05/12/25.

**Practical 10** - To be completed on 12/12/25.
